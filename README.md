This repo intends to provide curated set of Jupyter Python notebooks for the IGAC Short Course. 

The notebooks feature the following capabilities:
1. Data search/discovery
2. Data access/subset/extraction
3. Data plotting/analysis/visualization

## Special Notes for First-Time Users:
1. See the **[environment.yml](https://github.com/NASA-TROPESS/IGAC-ShortCourse/blob/main/environment.yml)** file for a list of dependencies.
2. If you not familiar with managing your own dependencies, we suggest utilizing the provided **[environment.yml](https://github.com/NASA-TROPESS/IGAC-ShortCourse/blob/main/environment.yml)** file, as follows:
   
  **Step 1:** Create a new conda environment called tropess-igac-env:
  
   -> Download the **[environment.yml](https://github.com/NASA-TROPESS/IGAC-ShortCourse/blob/main/environment.yml)** file.
   
   -> Install the free "mini" conda package: **[https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)**
   
   -> Run the following from your commandline: **conda env create --file environment.yml**
   
      
  **Step 2:** Initialize your new "tropess-igac-env" environemnt:
  
   -> Run the following from your commandline: **conda activate tropess-igac-env**
